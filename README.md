# Programming Foundations

Welcome to the **Programming Foundations** repository! This project is a personal journey to study the fundamentals of programming. The aim is to explore various programming languages and concepts, such as design patterns, system design, APIs, and more. Alongside developing programming skills, this project also aims to improve English proficiency.

## Objectives

1. **Explore Various Programming Languages**: 
   - Experiment with different programming paradigms and styles.
   - Implement simple to intermediate projects in each language.

2. **Study Key Concepts**:
   - **Design Patterns**: Understand and implement common patterns.
   - **System Design**: Learn the principles of designing scalable systems.
   - **APIs**: Build and consume APIs to understand their workings.
   - And more...

3. **Practice Using Git and GitHub**:
   - Regular commits with descriptive messages to track progress.
   - Branching and merging to manage different aspects of the project.

4. **Improve English Proficiency**:
   - All documentation and code comments will be in English.
   - Practice technical writing and communication.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- `/languages`: Contains subdirectories for different programming languages, where each language will have its own set of exercises, projects, and notes. For example:
  - `/languages/python`
  - `/languages/java`
  - `/languages/javascript`
  - And others...

- `/design-patterns`: This section includes explanations and implementations of various design patterns across different languages.

- `/system-design`: Notes, diagrams, and examples related to system architecture and design principles.

- `/api`: Projects and experiments focused on building and consuming APIs, including RESTful and other API paradigms.

- `/testing`: Resources and examples related to software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and other testing methodologies.

- `/algorithms`: Implementations and explanations of various algorithms, covering topics such as sorting, searching, data structures, and more.

- `/design-system`: Documentation and examples related to creating and maintaining design systems, including guidelines for UI components, styling, and overall UX principles.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
